# In code 1 and 2, Read glass.csv data set and x_train has all the data expect for type column data and y_train has only type column data 
x_train and y_train has been divided into 80:20 
Declared naive bayen ML algo for CODE 1 and SVM method for CODE 2, to fit and train data 
After prediction the data it is stored in y_pred and data is present in y_test

After running both the codes and as per comparing the accuracy between both the methods, We can say that NaiveBayen has performed better than the SVM method.
JUSTIFICATION :: Na√Øve Bayes algorithm is more accurate and efficient on large datasets since the space complexity and time is less when compared to SVM method.
